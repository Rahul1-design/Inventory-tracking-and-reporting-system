# Inventory Management System

A full-stack Inventory Management System built using **Next.js**, **Express.js**, **TypeScript**, **Redux Toolkit**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
The application allows users to manage products, track purchases/sales, and view analytics through a responsive dashboard UI.

This is my first full-stack project where I learned how to integrate frontend, backend, authentication, database schema design, and chart visualizations.
